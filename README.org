* ESP8266
** Overview
The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266][ESP8266]] is a low-cost micro-controller with built-in WiFi
manufactured by Expressif Systems. This repository contains a few
small Python programs I have wrote for this device.
** Development Kit
I'm using the [[http://www.heltec.cn/project/wifi_kit_8][Heltec Wifi Kit 8]] development board, which conveniently
has a built-in 0.91 inch OLED screen.
** Installation
In order to run these programs you must install the MicroPython
firmware on your device, instructions can be found [[https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html#intro][here]]. To upload the
scripts I suggest using the =mpy-upload= tool included in [[https://github.com/nickzoic/mpy-utils][mpy-utils]],
but there are several methods. Remember to upload a =main.py= file,
which calls the program (i.e. =import myprogram=). I've removed the
information about my Wifi network and API tokens, so you will have to
fill these in manually with your own.
** Description
*** airquality.py
This program displays the real-time air quality and temperature for your
current location (based on your IP address). It uses the [[http://aqicn.org][aqicn.org]] API
to get the information and updates every minute. You'll have to get
your own API token to use it, but this is very easy and also free.

*** world_time.py
This program simply displays the time in different parts of the world
(Toronto, London, and China). It uses the network time protocol (NTP).

*** christmas.py
This is a count-down to Christmas! It also uses NTP.
